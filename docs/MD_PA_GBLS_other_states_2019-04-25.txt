Juvenile records easier to seal in MA
Two tools in Maryland:
ExpungeMaryland self-screener tool but horrible completion rate
MDExpungement – started client facing, and can still be client facing, but geared towards attys
In MD so many free record clearance clinics, that it’s easier to stand in line for 2 hours and get help
rather than do it yourself
ExpungeMaryland – branch logic – conclusion – needs to be 3 questions:
 Answer questions that they don’t know the answer too
 Too many questions
 &gt;5 minutes
 Terminology was too complicated
Disclaimer may have been too put off’ish
User testing and discovery research:
 If final product is self screener, needs lots of user research
 Auto form – questions won’t be needed
 MA can get their own acct digitally if they set up their own acct.
PA have online publicly accessible records
MA – can search for records if you have the docket number – there is a special acct for attorneys – two
databases (probation is more accurate, the masscourts records is not complete)
MD built tool to be pro se but vast users were attorneys so changed model to be atty-facing
PA only for atty’s
Need docket numbers for in-court sealing (non-convictions) if you don’t want to wait
Mail in – only need PII not docket number – juvenile records
Expungement under 21 – mail in
Expungement – erroneous need docket number
Individual can request their own CORI - $25 or can request waiver for &lt;125% FPL
Snail mail process to get juvenile record
Maryland – discovery working with attys to develop but not user testing (no funding)
PAExpungement generator – Mike Hollander developer

PA passed clean slate law leads to auto expungement and sealing – employment attys want to build a
self-screener for the public to see if they are eligible for sealing and expungement. The conclusion is
that it is too complicated because of the eligibility requirements, not only offense based but looks at the
entire record.
(some eligibility is based on degree of offense, but there were no degrees other than hand-written notes
Pittsburgh legal aid have LOI to get funding for a self-screener (asked quinten for feedback)
Goal –
Quentin recommends tool for pro se
Matt recommends tool for atty’s first
Maryland self-help centers in courts
Matt at Harvard and has experience advocating for the automation with govt agency
Maryland – pro se user: can choose option to apply for help with legal services – website can email
application for assistance – use web scrapper to pre-fill their application
Nate built the record scraper for PA
How handle – should you expunge? One line, maybe expungeable, because not have access to one
thing that makes ineligible. You may not want to expunge if it is detrimental to a case, but not
prominent. Assume atty’s who use the website know the detrimental effects of expungement.
MD – two versions: (1) website and (2) chrome extension that can scrape records that the atty chose all
at once and auto generate forms

How do you handle privacy: MD and PA similar
(1) long term – time stamps; (2) do not store expungement pdf’s of expungement forms; (3) temp
stored on server side not client computer - clients don’t enter info because info is public; (4) atty user
name and password
Expungement – only store case numbers, atty name and what forms they printed out for analytics; don’t
store dockets or generated forms: identify number of cases expunged; takes 6 months to expunge, and
go back to see if the case was expunged.
MD and PA doesn’t do juvenile records – getting records and expunging records are very hard
MD juvenile records are auto sealed
Success in atty’s compete with each other because there is a counter on the screen – gamifying process
among attys

# Data

This folder contains all datasets used in the process of this project. Specifically, datasets have been broken out here into the following groups:

* [Raw data](raw) contains datasets in the format we obtained them in -- errors have not been fixed, holes have not been patched, and here there be dragons.
* [Cleaned data](cleaned) contains datasets that have been cleaned of errors and is now ready to be wrangled as needed for analyses.
* [Processed data](processed) contains datasets in the format needed for a specific analysis.

Each of these folders should also contain the scripts used to create the data included.

Please note that if your data is sensitive (i.e., can be tied to an individual), we do not want it in this repo. Please save it as a .csv (so it'll be blocked by our .gitignore) and contact a collaborator to figure out a solution for data storage moving forward.
